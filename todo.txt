- Include true rule based probabilities (always say no no matter what if rule based)
- Experiment with high thresholds for considering high stakes situations even if normally would always reject
- Lesion (remove) the unreasonable neighbor and see what happens
- Side payment fraction multiplying inside vs outside of utility transform
- Modify to include aggregate probabilities (not on individuals)
- ROC curve for logistic regression
 

 - Getting plots for individual level analysis
 - Add stuff to model and see
 - Different ways of estimating damage value (90% vs 25% point estimate vs gaussian mixture)


----

- Model with no threshold: only rule-based and agreement-based -- DIEGO pt 2
- Test the hypothesis that everyone is flexible, just that there are many thresholds (include 0 and \infty) -- DIEGO pt 2
- Add damage value to the high stakes calculation (it's not just the amount offered) -- DIEGO pt 3
    - Ratio? Difference? Log?
    - Compare with offer-only model

- Test (manually) different priors for individual type, or for threshold -- MINDY pt 1
    - and then put priors on the priors (by taking those 1//n probabilities, sampling those from distributions, and normalizing)

- Demographic analysis: group people in the dataset by their classified  -- MINDY pt 2
category and collect aggregate statistics on demographic data 

- Probit model
- Inference engine with direct Inference
